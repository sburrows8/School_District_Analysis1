# School_District_Analysis
##Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to assist Maria and her supervisor in providing data to use as evidence of academic dishonesty. Due to the size of the document, filtering through one by one is impractical; therefore, I will be using python and pandas to run queries to filter through the data.
###Results
* The district summary was not affected during this analysis. 
* The school summery was affected when I removed the 9th graders, the passing count slightly decreased. 
* Replacing the 9th grade scores made no impact as the point of the investigation was to prove they were not adding the 9th grade scores to begin with. 
* Replacing the 9th grade scores did not affect math and reading scores. 
* Replacing the 9th grade scores did not have much of a change regarding school spending.
* Replacing the 9th grade scores by school size did not make a change. 
*Replacing the 9th grade scores by school type did not make a change. 

##Summary
To summarize the above, when completing the analysis not much of a change appeared even after testing multple scenerios.
